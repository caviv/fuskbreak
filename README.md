## Read break.com page and build a clean one (locally)

I like [break.com](www.break.com), when I want to relax my time and see some funny cats on the interent or nice babes, I get into break.com and I pass my time nicely between coding. Just funny comments, funny videos and good time.

But, alas, there are some problems. The upper ads go on top of the content, making it even impossible to be read on the lap-top, and the videos, most of them just don't load on chrome. This is very frustrating, I want to see a nice clip, but it dosen't load. I want to see a funny picture but there is a huge upper ad on top of it, hiding the picture.  

**Summary of the problems in break.com**

*   Videos doen't not load (chrome on linux)
*   Wide and high top ad over the content !

**Here are images of the problem in break.com**

## The solution: A Fuskator for break.com

This is why I have created fuskbreak !, fuskbreak is a piece of software writte in go ([golang](https://www.golang.org)) that connects to break.com and creates a **new webpage locally** <u>with out the whole mambo-jambo around it</u>. Just a simple webpage with direct links to the content. Direct viedo links - download viedos from break.com and see the latest posts in a clean way of look.  

**The results of fuskbreak**

*   [![Just a clean page with direct links to videos - No ads](https://www.c2kb.com/fuskbreak/fuskbreak1t.jpg)](https://www.c2kb.com/fuskbreak/fuskbreak1.jpg)
*   [![Videos loads directly](https://www.c2kb.com/fuskbreak/fuskbreak2t.jpg)](https://www.c2kb.com/fuskbreak/fuskbreak2.jpg)

No bullshit. Just clean links directly to the videos.
